## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   I used Stack Overflow to help me with the volume slider. Everything else was from previous work I've done from a website I made a long time ago.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   The biggest challenge was raising against the clock to get the project done in time as I had only found out about this internship only a day before. Furthermore, I had to fit time to do it while also in the middle of college exams as the end of the semester is right around the corner. At first, I thought I wasn’t going to be able to do it, but as I looked at the requirements, I realized I could save some time by implementing past code I’ve done in the past to the project. In the end, I managed to finish the project, but I wish I had had more time to implement everything I wanted to do for it. Also, as I was doing the project, I realized I have to brush up on Javascript again. It took me a bit of time to get the volume slider going. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   Technology is always moving so rapidly, so I don’t think I will ever not have any questions when it comes to technology. I definitely would like to know more about the libraries that can be utilized to more efficiently and faster be able to do projects like the  “Light and sound Memory Game” we just made.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   I would have definitely had implemented all of the optional requirements and added some additional stuff myself. If I had had more time, I would have definitely love to add some animations.
